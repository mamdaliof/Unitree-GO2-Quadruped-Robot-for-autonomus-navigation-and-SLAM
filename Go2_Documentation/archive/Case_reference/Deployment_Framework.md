# Deployment Framework

When testing motion control algorithms, the robot needs to first stand up from the ground and then perform control; After the test is completed, the robot needs to return to the lying state; When an accident occurs during testing, the robot needs to exit the testing algorithm in a timely manner and slowly fall down.

In order to meet these requirements, developers need to develop a debugging framework in addition to developing motion control algorithms to achieve the above functions. This article will combine routines under `example/state_machine` to introduce how to design a debugging framework.

# State switching

## Damping state

In a damped state, the motor has no driving force when stationary and is subjected to a driving force opposite to the direction of rotation during rotation, simulating the resistance during the rotation process. The pseudo code for motor control is as follows:
```
motorCmd.q = 0
motorCmd.dq = 0
motorCmd.Kp = 0
motorCmd.Kd = 2.0
motorCmd.tau = 0
```
In this mode, all motors of the robot will slowly stop. This mode can be used for the initial state of robot startup, and can also allow the robot to smoothly collapse in case of problems. Generally, the `L2 + B` combination key of the remote control is defined as the key to enter damping mode, and the robot can enter damping mode from any state.

## Standing state

This is the interface between the damping state and the control state. In this state, users can control the robot to stand and lie down through the remote control. A robot in a damping state can stand up through this state and enter the control state, giving the control mode a reasonable initial state for the robot. The standing of this routine is achieved by adjusting the `kp/kd` parameter, and the pseudo code is as follows:

```
motorCmd.q = q_stand
motorCmd.dq = 0
motorCmd.Kp = kp * pd_ratio
motorCmd.Kd = kd * pd_ratio
motorCmd.tau = 0
```
This routine adjusts the `pd_ratio` through the `R1/R2` button on the remote control to achieve the robot`s standing and lying down.

## Control status

The control algorithm that needs to be tested for control state operation. When the robot is in a standing state and the `pd_ratio` exceeds a certain threshold, it can enter the control state, but other conditions cannot enter the control state.

## Switching logic

The switching logic in the routine is shown in the following figure. When the robot starts, it lies on the ground and is in a damping state. Press the remote control `R2` to enter the standing state, and press and hold `R2` to make the robot stand up. After the robot stabilizes, press the remote control `A` to enter control mode and conduct testing. After the test is completed, you can press the remote control `R2` to return to standing mode. If there are any problems during the test, you can press the remote control `L2+B` or enter the damping state through the program judgment.

# Program implementation

Below is a brief introduction to the main code implementation. Please refer to the source code for specific details.

## Overall framework

The debugging program has a total of three sub threads, which are used to receive data, run the controller, and send data. The main class is `RobotController<USER_CTRL>`, which is used to store data, operate on 3 sub threads, and has built-in open loop control for damping and standing states `USER_CTRL` is the control algorithm `RobotInterface` encapsulates the underlying state and instructions `Gamepad` is an advanced packaging for remote controls `SimpleStateMachine` is a state machine.

## Underlying state class: RobotInterface

`RobotInterface` vectorizes and encapsulates the underlying state and instructions. Its parent class is `BasicRobotInterface`, and its member variables include the robot's motor status, IMU information, and motor instructions. The member function `GetState()` is used to parse the underlying state messages of dds, `SetCommand()` is used to generate dds messages corresponding to motor commands, and `UpdateProjectedGravity()` is a kinematic calculation tool used to calculate the projection of the unit vector of gravity direction under body coordinates.

 

``` c++
  class BasicRobotInterface
  {
  public:
      BasicRobotInterface();

      void GetState(unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowState_ &state);

      virtual void SetCommand(unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowCmd_ &cmd) = 0;

      // motor states
      std::array<float, 12> jpos, jvel, tau;
      // IMU
      std::array<float, 4> quat;
      std::array<float, 3> rpy, gyro, projected_gravity;
      // motor commands
      std::array<float, 12> jpos_des, jvel_des, kp, kd, tau_ff;

  private:
      inline void UpdateProjectedGravity();
  };
```
`RobotInterface`is a subclass ofb `BasicRobotInterface`, which contains the specific implementation of `SetCommand()`.

```c++
class RobotInterface : public BasicRobotInterface
{
public:
    RobotInterface() : BasicRobotInterface();

    void SetCommand(unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowCmd_ &cmd);

private:
    void InitLowCmd();

    UNITREE_LEGGED_SDK::LowCmd low_cmd_raw;
};
```

During use, the thread receiving the underlying state calls the `GetState()` function to record the robot state in this object; The control algorithm thread reads the robot state from member variables, calculates motor instructions, and stores them back into this object by accessing them; The thread that sends the underlying instruction calls the `SetCommand()` function to write the instruction to the underlying control message that needs to be sent.

## Motion control class:ExampleUserController

`ExampleUserController` is the motion controller that needs to be tested, and its parent class is `BasicUserController`. 

```c++
class BasicUserController
{
public:
    BasicUserController();

    virtual void LoadParam(fs::path &param_folder) = 0;

    virtual void Reset(RobotInterface &robot_interface, Gamepad &gamepad) = 0;

    virtual void GetInput(RobotInterface &robot_interface, Gamepad &gamepad) = 0;

    virtual void Calculate() = 0;

    virtual std::vector<float> GetLog() = 0;

    float dt, kp, kd;
    std::array<float, 12> init_pos;
    std::array<float, 12> jpos_des;
};
```
The member variable `dt` stores the time step, `kp` stores the joint gain, and `kd` stores the joint damping `init_pos` stores the initial position of the joint, `jpos_des` Stores the joint target position. The member function `LoadParam()` is used to load the configuration file, `Reset()` is used to reset the controller, `GetInput()` is used to read the robot status and remote control information, and `Calculate()` runs the main control logic to calculate the control quantity and store it in the member variable `GetLog()` is used to generate logs. The above member functions are all virtual functions, and when testing different control algorithms, they are implemented by inheriting `BasicUserController`.

In the control algorithm thread, when switching to the control state, the main program runs the control algorithm by calling the member function of the class and accessing the member variable to obtain the control quantity.

`ExampleUserController` is an example of an actual controller that includes a simple implementation of the above virtual function, which can be used as a reference **In actual debugging, different subclasses are mainly written to achieve the control algorithms that need to be tested**

## State machine class: SimpleStateMachine

`SimpleStateMachine` is a simple state machine that can switch between standing, damping, and controlling states.

```c++
enum class STATES
{
  DAMPING = 0,
  STAND = 1,
  CTRL = 2
};

class SimpleStateMachine
{
public:
  SimpleStateMachine(double pd_ratio_init = 0.1, double delta_pd = 0.005) : state(STATES::STAND), pd_ratio(pd_ratio_init), delta_pd(delta_pd) {}

  bool Stop()
  {
      state = STATES::DAMPING;
      pd_ratio = 0.0;
      return true;
  }

  bool Stand()
  {
      if (state == STATES::DAMPING || state == STATES::CTRL)
      {
          state = STATES::STAND;
          return true;
      }
      else
      {
          return false;
      }
  }

  bool Ctrl()
  {
      if (state == STATES::STAND && pd_ratio > 0.95)
      {
          state = STATES::CTRL;
          return true;
      }
      else
      {
          return false;
      }
  }

  void Standing(bool up = true)
  {
      if (state == STATES::STAND)
      {
          if (up)
          {
              pd_ratio += delta_pd;
          }
          else
          {
              pd_ratio -= delta_pd;
          }
          pd_ratio = std::max(0.0, std::min(1.0, pd_ratio));
      }
  }

  STATES state;
  double pd_ratio;
  double delta_pd;
};
```

`STATES` is an enumeration class that defines three states: damping, standing, and control `SimpleStateMachine` contains the object `state` of the enumeration class and parameters used to control standing and lying down `pd_ratio` and `delta_pd`. `Stop()`, `Stand()` and `Ctrl()` are used to enter three states, respectively. If the entry is successful, it returns`true`, otherwise it returns`false`.

The `Standing()` function is used to adjust the `kp` and `kd` parameters while standing, achieving control over standing and lying down.

n the main program, the control thread first determines and executes state switching based on the state of the remote control, and then calls different functions based on the state of the state machine to execute different control logic.

## Robot control class: RobotController

`RobotController<USER_CTRL>` is the core class used to control program execution. This is a template class, `<USER_CTRL>` can be a subclass of the motion control class `BasicUserController`. In the main function, different motion control algorithms can be debugged by setting different motion control classes.

```c++
template <typename USER_CTRL>
class RobotController
{
public:
    RobotController() {};

    RobotController(fs::path &log_file_name);

    void InitDdsModel(const std::string &networkInterface = "");

    void LoadParam(fs::path &param_folder);

    void StartControl();

protected:
    ChannelPublisherPtr<unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowCmd_> lowcmd_publisher;
    ChannelSubscriberPtr<unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowState_> lowstate_subscriber;
    ThreadPtr low_cmd_write_thread_ptr, control_thread_ptr;
    unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowCmd_ cmd;
    unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowState_ state;

    Gamepad gamepad;
    REMOTE_DATA_RX rx;

    SimpleStateMachine state_machine;
    USER_CTRL ctrl;
    RobotInterface robot_interface;

    std::mutex state_mutex, cmd_mutex;

    std::ofstream log_file;

    uint64_t ctrl_dt_micro_sec = 2000;

    std::vector<float> compute_time;

private:
    void LowStateMessageHandler(const void *message);

    void InteprateGamePad();

    void LowCmdwriteHandler();

    void StartSendCmd();
    
    void UpdateStateMachine();
    
    void ControlStep();

    void WriteLog();

    void StandCallback();

    void CtrlCallback();

    void Damping(float kd = 2.0);

    void Standing(float kp = 40.0, float kd = 1.0);

    void UserControlStep(bool send = true);

    bool CheckTermination();
};
```

In addition to the constructor, the public member functions also include `InitDdsModel()`, `LoadParam()`, and `StartControl()`.

### Main function

The main logic of the main function is as follows: first, construct the object and set the log path, then load the controller configuration file through `LoadParam()`, connect the robot through `InitDdsModel()`, and finally start control through `StartControl()`.

```c++
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    // parse command line params
    std::string param_folder;

    for (int i = 1; i < argc; ++i)
    {
        std::string arg = argv[i];

        if (arg == "--param" && i + 1 < argc)
        {
            param_folder = argv[i + 1];
        }
    }
    fs::path param = fs::current_path() / param_folder;

    // set log file
    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    auto time = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(now);
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << std::put_time(std::localtime(&time), "%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S");

    fs::path log_folder = fs::current_path() / "logs" / ss.str();
    fs::create_directories(log_folder);

    std::ofstream cfg_file(log_folder / "cfg.txt");
    cfg_file << "param_folder: " << param << std::endl;
    cfg_file.close();

    fs::path log_file_name = log_folder / "log.txt";
  
    // start control
    RobotController<ExampleUserController> robot_controller(log_file_name);
  
    robot_controller.LoadParam(param);

    robot_controller.InitDdsModel();

    robot_controller.StartControl();

    return 0;
}
```
The main program first sets the configuration file path through command line parameters; Create a log file based on the current time.

### Load Configuration File

The `LoadParam()` function simply called `USER_CTRL.LoadParam()` function is used to load the configuration file.

```c++
void LoadParam(fs::path &param_folder)
{
    ctrl.LoadParam(param_folder);
}
```

### Establishing a connection

The content of `InitDdsModel()` is similar to the previous low-level control routine, used to establish a connection with the robot and set binding and callback functions.
```c++
void InitDdsModel(const std::string &networkInterface = "")
{
    // init dds
    ChannelFactory::Instance()->Init(0, networkInterface);
    lowcmd_publisher.reset(new ChannelPublisher<unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowCmd_>(TOPIC_LOWCMD));
    lowstate_subscriber.reset(new ChannelSubscriber<unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowState_>(TOPIC_LOWSTATE));

    lowcmd_publisher->InitChannel();
    lowstate_subscriber->InitChannel(std::bind(&RobotController::LowStateMessageHandler, this, std::placeholders::_1), 1);
}
```
In this example program, the callback function `LowStateMessageHandler()` that receives the message first stores the message object in the member variable `state` as a backup, and then updates the underlying state interface `robot_interface`.

```c++
void LowStateMessageHandler(const void *message)
{
    state = *(unitree_go::msg::dds_::LowState_ *)message;
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(state_mutex);
        robot_interface.GetState(state);
    }
}
```

### Turn on control

`StartControl()` is the core function for enabling control, with the main content as follows.

```c++
void StartControl()
{
    // waiting for gamepad command to start the control thread
    std::chrono::milliseconds duration(100);
    // listen to gamepad command
    while (true)
    {
        std::cout << "Press R2 to start!" << std::endl;
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(duration);

        InteprateGamePad();
        if (gamepad.R2.on_press)
        {
            break;
        }
    }

    // prepare for start
    // ...
}
```
After entering this function, the thread enters a dead loop to detect the status of the remote control. When the user presses` R2`, it jumps out of the loop for control.
```c++
void StartControl()
{
    // waiting for gamepad command to start the control thread
    // ...

    // prepare for start
    std::cout << "Start!" << std::endl;
    Damping();
    ctrl_dt_micro_sec = static_cast<uint64_t>(ctrl.dt * 1000000);

    // Start the control thread
    control_thread_ptr = CreateRecurrentThreadEx("ctrl", UT_CPU_ID_NONE, ctrl_dt_micro_sec, &RobotController::ControlStep, this);

    // Start the lowlevel command thread
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(duration);
    StartSendCmd();

    // keep the main thread alive
    while (true)
    {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(duration);
    }
}
```

After jumping out of the loop, the program starts the **motion control thread** and calls the `ControlStep()` function in a loop; After waiting for a short time, call the `StartSendCmd()` function to start **the underlying instruction thread**.

### Motion Control Thread

The motion control thread periodically executes the `ControlStep()` function, executing the actual control logic based on instructions. Each step of control consists of the following steps:

1. Update remote control status and state machine

2. Control based on status

3. Update dds underlying control messages

4. Record logs and collect performance information

    
```c++
void ControlStep()
{
    // main loop

    // update state
    InteprateGamePad();
    UpdateStateMachine();

    // select control modes according to the state machine
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    if (state_machine.state == STATES::STAND)
    {
        Standing();
    }
    if (state_machine.state == STATES::DAMPING)
    {
        Damping();
    }
    if (state_machine.state == STATES::CTRL)
    {
        UserControlStep(true);
        if (CheckTermination())
        {
            state_machine.Stop();
        }
    }

    // update low-level command
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(cmd_mutex);
        robot_interface.SetCommand(cmd);
    }

    auto stop = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(stop - start);
    compute_time.push_back(duration.count() / 1000.);

    // write log
    WriteLog();

    if (compute_time.size() == 100)
    {
        float sum = 0;
        for (auto &t : compute_time)
        {
            sum += t;
        }
        std::cout << "Performance: mean: " << sum / 100
                  << " ms; max: " << *std::max_element(compute_time.begin(), compute_time.end())
                  << " ms; min: " << *std::min_element(compute_time.begin(), compute_time.end())
                  << "ms." << std::endl;

        compute_time.clear();

        std::cout << "Current State: " << static_cast<size_t>(state_machine.state) << std::endl;
    }
}
```

#### State switching and callback

This routine uses a very simple state switching logic. When certain buttons are pressed, the program will call the member function in the `SimpleStateMachine` class for state switching. If successful, the corresponding callback function will be executed. The main implementation methods for state switching are as follows:

```c++
void UpdateStateMachine()
{
    // R2 -> Stand
    // A -> Ctrl
    // L2 + B -> Stop
    if (gamepad.R2.on_press)
    {
        if (state_machine.Stand())
        {
            StandCallback();
        }
    }
    if (gamepad.A.on_press)
    {
        if (state_machine.Ctrl())
        {
            CtrlCallback();
        }
    }
    if (gamepad.L2.pressed && gamepad.B.pressed)
    {
        state_machine.Stop();
    }
}
```

#### Damping state

When the state machine is in a damping state, the program calls the `Damping()` function for control, and the control logic is as follows:
```c++
void Damping(float kd = 2.0)
{
  robot_interface.jpos_des = ctrl.init_pos;
  robot_interface.jvel_des.fill(0.);
  robot_interface.kp.fill(0.);
  robot_interface.kd.fill(kd);
  robot_interface.tau_ff.fill(0.);
}
```

#### Control status

When the state machine is in control state, the program will first call `UserControlStep()` for control, then check the robot status. If protection is needed, it will automatically enter the damping state.

```c++
if (state_machine.state == STATES::CTRL)
{
    UserControlStep(true);
    if (CheckTermination())
    {
        state_machine.Stop();
    }
}
```
The `UserControlStep()` function calls the member function of the `ExampleUserController` class to run the controller that the user needs to test.

```c++
void UserControlStep(bool send = true)
{
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(state_mutex);
        ctrl.GetInput(robot_interface, gamepad);
    }
    ctrl.Calculate();

    if (send)
    {
        robot_interface.jpos_des = ctrl.jpos_des;
    }
}
```
The `CheckTermination()` function in this routine checks whether the robot`s body tilt exceeds 90 degrees. If it exceeds 90 degrees, it triggers the protection to enter a damping state. During the development process, the protection rules can be adjusted according to the actual situation.

```c++
bool CheckTermination()
{
    if (robot_interface.projected_gravity.at(2) > 0)
    {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
#### Standing state

When the state machine is in a standing state, the program calls the `Standing()` function for control.

```c++
void Standing(float kp = 40.0, float kd = 1.0)
{
  if (gamepad.R2.pressed)
  {
      state_machine.Standing(true);
  }
  if (gamepad.R1.pressed)
  {
      state_machine.Standing(false);
  }

  UserControlStep(false);

  robot_interface.kp.fill(kp * state_machine.pd_ratio);
  robot_interface.kd.fill(kd * state_machine.pd_ratio);
}
```
The main control logic for standing status is to adjust the standing height based on the remote control buttons.

For debugging convenience, the standing mode of this routine will also run the user control logic as a test, which calculates the control amount based on the robot's state, but does not send instructions.

### Compile Run

After compiling the entire sdk routine, pass in parameters through --param when using it. The compile and run commands are as follows:

```bash
# build the sdk and all examples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# run
./state_machine_example --param ../example/state_machine/params
```
The above is an example of a debugging framework. If you need to directly use this framework, you can directly develop a new controller in `user_controller.hpp`.
